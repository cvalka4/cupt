cupt (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Cupt:
    - System:
      - Worker:
        - 'update_release_and_index_data': fixed downloading of non-compressed
          indexes.
        - 'update_release_and_index_data': fixed removing downloaded file after
          uncompressing.
        - 'update_release_and_index_data': remove the downloaded Release.gpg if
          signature verification failed and 'cupt::update::keep-bad-signatures'
          is false (this is the default setting) for the compatibility with APT.
          Thanks to Goswin von Brederlow <goswin-v-b@web.de>.
          (Closes: #533753). Urgency is set to 'medium' because of this fix.
        - 'update_release_and_index_data': download index file even if
          signature download/check failed.
      - Resolvers/Native:
        - Reworked solution rank system.
        - Dropped 'first-good' solution chooser. It can be mimicked by setting
          'max-solution-count' option to 1.
        - Run cleaning auto-installed packages also before resolving, aiming
          to reduce number of solutions resolver should work with.
        - Made "zero" line for actions 400 points less, affecting ordering
          solutions for processing for default 'fair' resolver type. Leads to
          significant (several times) speed-up for some cases. Makes possible
          to obtain at least one solution for some hard queries (like removing
          core system components).
        - Fixed erroneous auto-removing of some dependencies which were brought
          by 'satisfy' query.
    - Download:
      - Manager:
        - Enabled basic HTTPS protocol support.
        - IPC is rewritten using UNIX sockets instead of fifos.
      - Progress:
        - Changed speed-o-meter accuracy to 4 seconds (previous value was
          2 seconds).
      - Methods/Curl:
        - Added basic handling of transitive download errors.
    - Cache:
      - New free subroutine 'verify_signature'.
      - BinaryVersion:
        - [API break] Renamed field 'source_name' to 'source_package_name'.
        - Added a check for hash sums presence. Thanks to
          Goswin von Brederlow <goswin-v-b@web.de>.
        - Added a check for version string presence.
    - Config:
      - Added configuration option 'apt::cache-limit'. Thanks to
        Goswin von Brederlow <goswin-v-b@web.de>. (Closes: #533752)
      - New configuration option 'cupt::update::keep-bad-signatures'.
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.2, no changes needed.

          possible 'update' action.
        - Worker thread: handle concurrent request of the same URI properly.
        - Worker thread: pass correct URI to download progress in case of
          ACKed download.
        - 'download' method: switched to modern interface of File::Temp,
          getting rid of compatibility one.
        - 'download' method: use POSIX::mkfifo instead of calling 'mkfifo'
          program.
        - 'download' method: return final download result back to worker
          thread only if this was requested.
        - New forwarding methods 'set_long_alias_for_uri' and
          'set_short_alias_for_uri'.

cupt (0.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * cupt:
    - 'policy' subcommand:
      - Fixed old code referrings to 'gettext'.
    - Fixed skipping option-like arguments when searching for a command.
    - Implemented option '--show-reasons' for management actions.
    - New 'copyright' subcommand, similar to 'changelog' subcommand. Currently
      implemented only for installed packages and official Debian and Ubuntu
      repositories.
    - 'changelog', 'copyright' subcommands: work around dropping an epoch from
      version strings in links to Debian/Ubuntu pages.
    - The option '--install-unpacked' went away in favor of new
      '--no-install-unpacked' one, installing unpacked packages is now the
      default.
  * Cupt:
    - System:
      - Resolver:
        - Fixed erroneous autovivification of package entries which are not
          installed when checking for sticks of candidate versions than can
          satisfy forward dependencies.
        - Fixed wrong sharing 'fake satisfied' entries between package entries
          in different solution branches.
        - Honor 'cupt::resolver::track-reasons' configuration option.
      - Worker:
        - APT mangles ':' chars in names of deb archives. Cupt doesn't do the
          same. So, to pick up debs downloaded by libapt, worker now generates
          symlinks from 'right' names to 'mangled' names whenever possible.
        - Moved downloading stage to start of 'do_actions' method.
        - Reverted "Don't introduce action loops when uniting 'remove' and
          'unpack' actions".
        - Instead, tried to drop extraneous action interdepedencies by using and
          checking saved relation info and merging 'unpack' with 'configure'.
        - And, since unconditional merging 'unpack' with 'configure' can
          introduce another dependency loops, perform merge only if the
          operation can "eat" some dependencies.
        - In case some package have only 'configure' action without 'unpack',
          check for conflicts too in a straightforward way.
        - In the series of heterogeneous actions pass '--force-conflicts' to
          the '--unpack' and '--install'.
        - Generate stdin version 2 for the 'dpkg::pre-install-pkgs' hook for
          all hooks declared, not only for apt-listchanges.
        - Implemented the installs, downgrades and removes for the stdin
          version 2 for the 'dpkg::pre-install-pkgs' hook.
    - Config:
      - New configuration option 'cupt::resolver::track-reasons'.
    - Cache:
      - New free subroutine 'get_path_of_debian_copyright'.
      - When parsing release data, require first symbol of version to be digit.
  * doc:
    - cupt.1:
      - Renewed the list of supported APT configuration options.
      - Mentioned the way to send bug reports and IRC discussion channel.

  * cupt:
    - 'show' subcommand:
      - Show also source version if present.

      - Use source version for fetching remote changelogs if present. Fixes
        determining remote path for versions that had a binary-only rebuild(s).
    - 'policy' subcommand:
      - When called without arguments, print available Releases.
    - Exclude superfluous 'use Locale::gettext', Cupt::Core module do all
      needed manipulations to provide gettext. Thanks to
      David Broome <dbroome@gmail.com>. (Closes: #529167)
  * Cupt:
    - Cache:
      - New method 'get_binary_release_data'.
      - New method 'get_source_release_data'.
      - Include base URI in release info.

        codename 'now', vendor 'dpkg' in release info.
      - BinaryVersion:

        - [API break] Renamed method 'versions' to 'get_versions'.
      - Skip 'Explanation: ' lines when parsing preferences. Thanks to
        Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@debian.org>.
    - Download:
      - Manager, Methods/*:
        - Changed "success" error message from '0' to ''.
      - Manager:
        - Worker thread and 'download' method: now worker thread returns info
          had the download been processed before or not, and 'download' won't
          run post-action for already processed downloads; this change should
          avoid future race conditions when the multiple downloads of the same
          file with enabled postprocessing were scheduled.
        - Worker thread and 'download' method: delay sending result to
          download progress before 'download' acked the result
          (i.e. run post-check for it).
      - Method:
        - New free subroutine 'get_acquire_suboption_for_uri' which honors
          per-host settings.
    - Config:
      - Per-host suboption of 'acquire::*::timeout' is now supported.
    - System:
      - Worker:
        - 'do_actions': perform dpkg lock (if needed) before all other
          prepare actions, not before modifying system.

      - New subroutine 'is_version_string_native'.
    - Download:
      - Manager:
        - [API break] 'download' method: now one should specify array of URIs,
          not single URI for each download entry. Enables mirroring feature.

        - Give back transparent versioned 'remove','unpack','configure'
          actions and versionful check. Heavy hacks didn't guarantee full
          correctness, no reason to have them anymore.
        - Don't introduce action loops when uniting 'remove' and 'unpack'
          actions. This has to fix upgrading of packages containing
          'Pre-Depends' dependencies finally.
        - Put also installed and downgraded packages to package list version 1

          'max-solution-cont' internal param.
        - [API break] Removed 'set_params' method, it is not needed anymore.
    - Cache:
      - Typo fix: 'incorrent' -> 'incorrect'. Thanks to
        Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@debian.org>.
      - Implemented 'easy' type of sources.list entry. Thanks to
        Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@debian.org>.
      - Don't choke on empty-for-us index files. Thanks to

        - Honor 'cupt::worker::download-only' option.
        - Added 'debug::worker' config option to print some debug info.
        - Bump Pre-Depends requirements to 'configure' to make sure to not
          violate Debian Policy.
        - Merge all 'unpack' + 'configure' actions into 'install' action
          unconditionally.
        - Don't create fake 'remove' actions, just use existing 'install'
          ones instead. This should resolve problems with scheduling
          upgrading packages containing 'Pre-Depends'.
        - Made all inter-action relations unversioned, this should ensure that
          all 'install' -> 'remove' and 'remove' -> 'install' dependencies are
          not underestimated.
        - Ensure that download manager is destroyed before processing the
          result of downloads.
    - Config:
      - New option 'cupt::worker::download-only', defaults to false.
      - Use value of 'dir::bin::dpkg', not plain 'dpkg' to obtain
        archirecture.
      - The option 'gpgv::trustedkeyring' now defaults to
        '/var/lib/cupt/trusted.gpg'.
    - Cache:
      - Introduce the hack to copy APT's trusted keyring whenever possible to
        cupt's keyring place. It will be removed once key update mechanism
        would be implemented.
      - When checking signatures, generate proper error message if the keyring
        file doesn't exist.
      - Relation:
        - New free subroutine 'parse_relation_line' for parsing relation
          sequences.
  * debian/libcupt-perl.postinst:
    - Don't mess with /etc/apt/trusted.gpg for now. Instead copy it to cupt's
      own keyring place.
  * debian/libcupt-perl.prerm:
    - Introduced to clean up /var/lib/cupt directory.
