        time in case of recursive rdepends.
  * Cupt:

          mutator methods (fields). Documented all fields.
        - Don't choke if 'Section' field is not defined.

          including "essentialness" of the version.
        - Fixed a crash when performing a deep search for versions that have
          other than original version have, but still satisfiable
          pre-dependency relation expression.
        - Check Recommends/Suggests only when all hard dependencies are
          satisfied.
        - Resolver doesn't unconditionally pre-install Recommends and/or
          Suggests of manually installed/upgraded/downgraded packages
          (if 'apt::install-recommends' and 'apt::install-suggests' turned on,
          respectively) anymore. This change has two main consequences:
          + The common pinning/resolver rules are now applied to
            Recommends/Suggests of manually specified packages too. Besides of
            grown inner flexibility, you can now pin out specific packages or
            versions you don't like.
          + If you upgrade/downgrade the package which has unsatisfied
            Recommends/Suggests and the old and new version of the package
            has the same relation expression, resolver won't try to change
            anything.

        - Honor 'dpkg::options' option.
    - Download:
      - Manager:
        - Worker thread: handle duplicated download requests that come when
          the original download request is not yet completed. This use case is
          possible 'update' action.
        - Worker thread: handle concurrent request of the same URI properly.
        - Worker thread: pass correct URI to download progress in case of
          ACKed download.
        - 'download' method: switched to modern interface of File::Temp,
          getting rid of compatibility one.
        - 'download' method: use POSIX::mkfifo instead of calling 'mkfifo'
          program.
        - 'download' method: return final download result back to worker
          thread only if this was requested.
        - New forwarding methods 'set_long_alias_for_uri' and
          'set_short_alias_for_uri'.
    - Cache:
      - 'get_pin' method: divided into 'get_original_apt_pin' and 'get_pin'

cupt (0.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * cupt:
    - 'policy' subcommand:
      - Fixed old code referrings to 'gettext'.
    - Fixed skipping option-like arguments when searching for a command.
    - Implemented option '--show-reasons' for management actions.
    - New 'copyright' subcommand, similar to 'changelog' subcommand. Currently
      implemented only for installed packages and official Debian and Ubuntu
      repositories.
    - 'changelog', 'copyright' subcommands: work around dropping an epoch from
      version strings in links to Debian/Ubuntu pages.
    - The option '--install-unpacked' went away in favor of new
      '--no-install-unpacked' one, installing unpacked packages is now the
      default.
  * Cupt:
    - System:
      - Resolver:
        - Fixed erroneous autovivification of package entries which are not
          installed when checking for sticks of candidate versions than can
          satisfy forward dependencies.
        - Fixed wrong sharing 'fake satisfied' entries between package entries
          in different solution branches.
        - Honor 'cupt::resolver::track-reasons' configuration option.
      - Worker:
        - APT mangles ':' chars in names of deb archives. Cupt doesn't do the
          same. So, to pick up debs downloaded by libapt, worker now generates
          symlinks from 'right' names to 'mangled' names whenever possible.
        - Moved downloading stage to start of 'do_actions' method.
        - Reverted "Don't introduce action loops when uniting 'remove' and
          'unpack' actions".
        - Instead, tried to drop extraneous action interdepedencies by using and
          checking saved relation info and merging 'unpack' with 'configure'.
        - And, since unconditional merging 'unpack' with 'configure' can
          introduce another dependency loops, perform merge only if the
          operation can "eat" some dependencies.
        - In case some package have only 'configure' action without 'unpack',
          check for conflicts too in a straightforward way.
        - In the series of heterogeneous actions pass '--force-conflicts' to
          the '--unpack' and '--install'.
        - Generate stdin version 2 for the 'dpkg::pre-install-pkgs' hook for
          all hooks declared, not only for apt-listchanges.
        - Implemented the installs, downgrades and removes for the stdin
          version 2 for the 'dpkg::pre-install-pkgs' hook.
    - Config:
      - New configuration option 'cupt::resolver::track-reasons'.
    - Cache:
      - New free subroutine 'get_path_of_debian_copyright'.
      - When parsing release data, require first symbol of version to be digit.
  * doc:
    - cupt.1:
      - Renewed the list of supported APT configuration options.
      - Mentioned the way to send bug reports and IRC discussion channel.

cupt (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Fixed misspelled Recommends 'liblocale-gettext-perl'.
    - Allow DM uploads.
  * cupt:
    - 'show' subcommand:
      - Show also source version if present.
    - 'changelog' subcommand:
      - Use source version for fetching remote changelogs if present. Fixes
        determining remote path for versions that had a binary-only rebuild(s).
    - 'policy' subcommand:
      - When called without arguments, print available Releases.
    - Exclude superfluous 'use Locale::gettext', Cupt::Core module do all
      needed manipulations to provide gettext. Thanks to
      David Broome <dbroome@gmail.com>. (Closes: #529167)
  * Cupt:
    - Cache:
      - New method 'get_binary_release_data'.
      - New method 'get_source_release_data'.
      - Include base URI in release info.
      - Installed versions of packages now have archive 'installed',
        codename 'now', vendor 'dpkg' in release info.
      - BinaryVersion:
        - New field 'source_package_version'. It's got filled when the source
          version for package differs from the binary one.
      - Pkg:
        - [API break] Renamed to 'Package'.
        - [API break] Renamed method 'versions' to 'get_versions'.
      - Skip 'Explanation: ' lines when parsing preferences. Thanks to
        Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@debian.org>.
    - Download:
      - Manager, Methods/*:
        - Changed "success" error message from '0' to ''.
      - Manager:
        - Worker thread and 'download' method: now worker thread returns info
          had the download been processed before or not, and 'download' won't
          run post-action for already processed downloads; this change should
          avoid future race conditions when the multiple downloads of the same
          file with enabled postprocessing were scheduled.
        - Worker thread and 'download' method: delay sending result to
          download progress before 'download' acked the result
          (i.e. run post-check for it).
      - Method:
        - New free subroutine 'get_acquire_suboption_for_uri' which honors
          per-host settings.
    - Config:
      - Per-host suboption of 'acquire::*::timeout' is now supported.
    - System:
      - Worker:
        - 'do_actions': perform dpkg lock (if needed) before all other
          prepare actions, not before modifying system.

    - Implemented '--no-remove' option for management actions.
    - Implemented '--no-auto-remove' option for management actions.
    - Selecting a version for binary package:
      - Allow '-' symbols in distribution names.

      packages and official Debian and Ubuntu repositories.
  * Cupt:
    - Core:
      - 'mydie', 'myerr', 'mywarn' subroutines now print to STDERR. Thanks to
        Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@debian.org>.
      - New subroutine 'is_version_string_native'.
    - Download:
      - Manager:
        - [API break] 'download' method: now one should specify array of URIs,
          not single URI for each download entry. Enables mirroring feature.
        - Advanced error message in download size check.
      - Methods/Curl:
        - Detect HTTP/FTP/HTTPS error codes.
        - Put HTTP/FTP/HTTPS response codes into error messages.
        - Don't put Curl internal error codes into error messages.
        - Follow HTTP redirects if the option
          'acquire::http::allow-redirects' is set to true.
      - Progress:
        - 'get_overall_download_percent': fixed division by zero when
          estimated total is zero.
      - Progresses/Console:
        - Enable auto-flushing when printing to the terminal.
    - System:
      - Worker:
        - Adapted to to changes in 'download' method of download manager.
        - Send also base URI to download progress so it can display it.
        - Give back transparent versioned 'remove','unpack','configure'
          actions and versionful check. Heavy hacks didn't guarantee full
          correctness, no reason to have them anymore.
        - Don't introduce action loops when uniting 'remove' and 'unpack'
          actions. This has to fix upgrading of packages containing
          'Pre-Depends' dependencies finally.
        - Put also installed and downgraded packages to package list version 1
          output for hooks. Dpkg-preconfigure should now work fully under Cupt.
        - Honor 'dpkg::pre-invoke' option.
        - Advanced error output for dpkg 'pre' actions.
        - Honor 'dpkg::post-invoke' option.

          param.
        - Check 'cupt::resolver::type' option for validity.
        - Use 'cupt::resolver::max-solution-count' option instead of
          'max-solution-cont' internal param.
        - [API break] Removed 'set_params' method, it is not needed anymore.
    - Cache:
      - Typo fix: 'incorrent' -> 'incorrect'. Thanks to
        Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@debian.org>.
      - Implemented 'easy' type of sources.list entry. Thanks to
        Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@debian.org>.
      - Don't choke on empty-for-us index files. Thanks to
        Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@debian.org>.
      - Fixed determining path for storing list file for indexes whose protocol

      - Require typing the confirmation phrase for really dangerous actions.
      - Changed 'installed' -> 'INSTALLED' for untrusted packages warning.
    - 'satisfy' subcommand:
      - Now accepts sequences of relation expressions divided by commas within

        float values.
    - Download:
      - Method, Methods/*:
        - [API break] 'sub_callback' in 'perform', added fetched bytes
          parameter for 'downloading' callback
        - Various documentation improvements.
      - Manager:
        - Road all progress requests through own pipe, not directly.
        - Update progress meter several times during a second.
        - Made more strings translatable.

        - Various documentation improvements.
      - Progresses/Console:
        - Substituted obsoleted 'progress' method with new 'hook' method.

          human-readable form too (in addition to all size bytes count for
          package). In four words, "10829837/15.9MiB" -> '10.1MiB/15.9MiB'.
    - System:
      - Worker:
        - Honor 'cupt::worker::download-only' option.
        - Added 'debug::worker' config option to print some debug info.
        - Bump Pre-Depends requirements to 'configure' to make sure to not
          violate Debian Policy.
        - Merge all 'unpack' + 'configure' actions into 'install' action
          unconditionally.
        - Don't create fake 'remove' actions, just use existing 'install'
          ones instead. This should resolve problems with scheduling
          upgrading packages containing 'Pre-Depends'.
        - Made all inter-action relations unversioned, this should ensure that
          all 'install' -> 'remove' and 'remove' -> 'install' dependencies are

        file doesn't exist.
      - Relation:
        - New free subroutine 'parse_relation_line' for parsing relation
          sequences.
  * debian/libcupt-perl.postinst:
    - Don't mess with /etc/apt/trusted.gpg for now. Instead copy it to cupt's
      own keyring place.
