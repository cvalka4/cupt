Core advantages:
 - Pins can be specified also by source package.
 - Correctness of APT options is checked.

Advantages over apt-cache:
 - 'search' command searches all versions of package, not policy or
   default ones;
 - 'search' command can search case-sensitively ('--case-sensitive' switch);
 - 'show' command can show release description ('--with-release-info' switch);
 - '/<distribution' and '=<version>' suffixes can be used with 'show' (you
   should also specify --no-all-versions) and 'depends' commands.
